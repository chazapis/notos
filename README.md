# NOTOS

Django application for managing registrations for the [NOTOS 2021](http://hps.gr/notos2021/) philatelic exhibition. The application presents the user with a selection of authentication options (local or third-party, like Google, Twitter, and Facebook) and then a series of forms, organized into steps, to fill in personal information, appointments, entries to the exhibition, and travel details.

The application is open source, highly configurable and easily customizable, in order to be used by other exhibitions as well.

For instructions on how to run for development or deployment, consult the [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) file.
